# Survey form with React

## **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
- Your site should follow accessibility guidelines.

## The problem

At first I had problems with getting the form to go to the next question.
